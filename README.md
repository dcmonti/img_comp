# Image Compression Tool with DCT2 Implementation

## Overview

This Python project is a simple application with a graphical user interface (GUI) that implements the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT2) to compress JPEG images. Users can adjust parameters to balance image quality and file size.

## Usage
```
pip install -m requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## Acknowledgments

The project utilizes the following Python libraries:

- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/): A powerful library for numerical operations.
- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/): Built on NumPy, SciPy provides additional functionality for scientific computing.
- [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html): Python's standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) toolkit.
- [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/): An image processing library that extends the capabilities of the Python Imaging Library (PIL).
